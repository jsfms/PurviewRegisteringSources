# PurviewScan
Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, I present a script that addresses a specific challenge encountered during the migration process from Azure Database for MySQL and PostgreSQL Single Server to Flexible Server.

As you may be aware, Azure is transitioning its services, and the retirement path for Azure Database for MySQL and PostgreSQL Single Server has been established. In order to ensure a smooth transition, it is highly recommended to migrate to Flexible Server. However, one hurdle we face is that the Purview connector is currently not compatible with Flexible Server via the user interface (UI).

To overcome this compatibility limitation, we need to leverage the power of the Purview's API. The script provided in this repository serves as a solution to accomplish the migration mission. It enables seamless interaction with the Purview connector by utilizing the API functionalities, allowing you to effectively manage your data and maintain data integrity throughout the migration process.

By making use of this script, you will be able to ensure a successful migration from Azure Database for MySQL and PostgreSQL Single Server to Flexible Server, even in the absence of UI compatibility. This solution will empower you to harness the benefits of Flexible Server while seamlessly integrating with Purview.

Feel free to explore the script, adapt it to your specific requirements, and provide any feedback or suggestions. Together, we can overcome the challenges posed by this migration and unlock the full potential of Azure's database services.

Thank you for visiting this repository, and I hope this script proves to be valuable in your migration journey. Happy coding!

Note: It is essential to thoroughly review the script and ensure it aligns with your specific requirements and best practices before implementing it in your environment.
